Outflow boundary conditions in FLUENT are used to model flow exits where the details of the flow velocity and pressure are not known prior to solution of the flow problem. You do not define any conditions at outflow boundaries (unless you are modeling radiative heat transfer, a discrete phase of particles, or split mass flow): FLUENT extrapolates the required information from the interior. It is important, however, to understand the limitations of this boundary type.
